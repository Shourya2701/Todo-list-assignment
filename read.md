Task: Create a Simple To-Do List with Undo Feature

Requirements:
Implement a To-Do List using React.
The user should be able to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
Implement an Undo functionality:
The undo should reverse the last operation (either adding, marking, or deleting a task).
You should maintain an undo stax	ck where the last 5 operations can be undone.
Display a button that allows the user to Undo the last action.

Instructions:
Use React functional components and hooks like useState and useEffect.
For undo functionality, maintain an undo stack to store the history of state changes.
Keep the UI simple, with a list of tasks and buttons to add, complete, and delete tasks.

Example Features:
Add Task: Add a new task to the list.
Complete Task: Mark a task as completed (strike-through effect).
Delete Task: Remove a task from the list.
Undo: Undo the last add, complete, or delete operation.

Key Expectations:
Proper use of React state management (e.g., using useState).
Ability to handle an undo stack efficiently (using arrays or another suitable structure).
Clean, minimal UI with a focus on functionality.

Bonus:
Use keyboard shortcut - `ctrl + z` for undo, and enter to add a task.
